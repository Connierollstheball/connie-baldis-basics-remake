## Connie's Baldis Basics Remake
Welcome to the Repository of my Baldi's Basics Remake. This is meant to replicate the experience of Baldi's Basics to the best of my coding ability.
This is a small project of mine that I started mostly to gain more experience with the Unity Game Engine, but also just for the hell of it.

All of the code in this project is written by me except the Billboarding Script, which I got from another source (linked in the respective script).
All other assets (textures and audio files) were taken directly from Baldi's Basics, created by MystMan12.

You can do whatever you want with this project, but it would be nice if you credited me if you made your own project with this project as its base.

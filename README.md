## Connie's Baldis Basics Remake
Welcome to the Repository of my Baldi's Basics Remake. This is meant to replicate the experience of Baldi's Basics to the best of my coding ability.
This is a small project of mine that I started mostly to gain more experience with the Unity Game Engine, but also just for the hell of it.

All of the code in this project is written by me except the Billboarding Script, which I got from another source (linked in the respective script).
All other assets (Textures and Audio Files) were taken directly from Baldi's Basics, created by MystMan12.

## Running
1) Clone the Repository
2) Obviously, you gotta have Unity to be able to open this
3) Literally just open the Project in Unity

On the off-chance that you have problems with oppening the project file up, please DM me on Discord **(connie_of_ro)** and I'll see if I can fix it.

## Similarity to the Baldi's Basics Classic
Currently, the project doesn't have everything BBs Classic has, and some of the other stuff that is in the project (specifically character behaviors, but other stuff too) may not 1-to-1 match what is seen in Baldi's Basics Classic.
I am, however, relatively actively working towards adding more stuff and enhancing the experience.

## Contributing
I accept any form of contributions towards the project, whether they be additions, fixes, or enhancements, through Pull Requests.
Feel free to contribute any change you think will help the project!

## Modifying and Remixing
You can do whatever you want with this project, but it would be nice if you credited me if you made your own project with this project as its base.
Also, it would be a good idea to credit both MystMan12 for the original assets (Sounds and Textures), as well as keep the link in the Billboarding Script towards the place where I took the script from.

Other than that, feel free to remix and change this project as much as you wish and re-release it under a different name if you wish to do so.
